This will be a Address Book made in Silex/Twig. The information will be stored user side in their cookies. It will store the person's name, address, and phone number
To host the program, download the root folder and go to the Contact/Web folder and host a web server from there with php. I use php -S localhost:8000. Then enter localhost:8000 in the search engine.
